# ⭐ StellarProof — The Truth Engine for the Stellar Ecosystem

StellarProof is a decentralized digital content verification and provenance platform built on the Stellar blockchain. It enables creators, developers, and platforms to generate immutable authenticity proofs for digital media directly on-chain using **Soroban smart contracts** (Stellar's native smart contract platform built on Rust/WASM).

StellarProof provides **Proof-as-a-Service APIs**, allowing any application to verify content origin, integrity, and authenticity using a hybrid **Web2 + Web3 verification pipeline**.

## 🌐 What StellarProof Solves

Digital media today can easily be manipulated, forged, or misrepresented (e.g., Deepfakes, AI-generated content). StellarProof provides a robust solution through:

*   **✅ Tamper-proof content provenance**: Ensures the history and origin of content are recorded immutably.
*   **✅ Cryptographic authenticity verification**: Uses advanced cryptographic techniques to verify that media has not been altered.
*   **✅ On-chain certification of digital media**: Mints a permanent record on the Stellar blockchain that serves as a "digital birth certificate" for the asset.
*   **✅ Trustless verification for third-party apps**: Allows external applications to verify media without relying on a central authority.
*   **✅ Secure encryption and access control**: Protects sensitive media content while allowing controlled sharing.
*   **✅ Developer APIs for integration**: Simplifies the integration of trust verification into existing workflows.

## 🚀 Core Architecture

StellarProof combines **Web2 infrastructure** (for speed and storage) with **Web3 trust guarantees** (for immutability and verification).

```

## ⚙️ Key Features

### 📂 Media Provenance Verification
*   **Upload**: Supports images, videos, documents, or AI-generated media.
*   **Manifest**: Attaches a JSON manifest describing origin metadata (creator, timestamp, device info).
*   **Certification**: Generates immutable authenticity certificates on Stellar.

### 🔐 Encryption & Access Control (KMS)
StellarProof provides a comprehensive Key Management Service that:
*   **Encrypts media** before it enters the storage layer, ensuring privacy.
*   **Controls decryption permissions**, allowing creators to specify who can view the content.
*   **Enables creator-controlled content access** via dynamic policies.
*   **Supports key rotation and audit trails** for enterprise-grade security.

### 🧠 Trusted Off-Chain Verification (TEE Oracle)
StellarProof leverages **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)** to bridge off-chain data with on-chain trust.
*   **AWS Nitro Enclaves**: Provides a highly isolated compute environment to protect verification code and data from external tampering.
*   **Oracle Worker Nodes**: Orchestrate the flow of data between storage and the TEE.
*   **Cryptographic Attestation**: The TEE generates a signed proof that the verification code ran correctly and produced specific results.
    *   Verifies media integrity against the manifest.
    *   Verifies manifest authenticity.
    *   Generates signed attestation hashes for the blockchain.

### 📜 On-Chain Provenance Certificates
Soroban contracts mint immutable certificates containing:
*   **Storage reference IDs**: Links to the off-chain media (IPFS CID or Database ID).
*   **Manifest hash**: Ensures the metadata hasn't been altered.
*   **Attestation proof hash**: Links to the TEE verification result.
*   **Timestamp & Creator Identity**: Proves when and by whom the content was created.

### 🧪 Proof-as-a-Service APIs
Developers can easily integrate StellarProof:
*   **Submit verification jobs**: `POST /api/verify/submit`
*   **Query certificate status**: `GET /api/verify/status/:jobId`
*   **Receive webhook notifications**: Real-time updates on verification progress.

## 🧭 How StellarProof Works

### 👤 Creator Workflow

1.  **Manifest Creation**: Creators prepare a JSON manifest containing content hash, timestamp, creator metadata, and optional device/AI info.
2.  **Upload Media & Manifest**: Uploaded via `/creator/upload-content`.
3.  **Optional Encryption**: Media is encrypted using StellarProof KMS, generating encryption metadata and access policies.
4.  **Storage Layer**: Files are stored on **IPFS** (for decentralization) or **MongoDB** (for speed). A storage reference ID is returned.
5.  **Verification Request**: The creator submits a request to the Soroban smart contract.
6.  **TEE Oracle Verification**:
    *   The Oracle Worker fetches files.
    *   Executes verification inside the **AWS Nitro Enclave**.
    *   Produces an attestation report and verification hash.
7.  **On-Chain Certification**: Soroban contract verifies the attestation and mints a **Provenance Certificate**.

### 👨‍💻 Developer / Integrator Workflow

*   **POST** `/api/verify/submit`: Submit a new media file for verification.
*   **GET** `/api/verify/status/:jobId`: Check the status of the verification process.
*   **POST** `/api/webhook`: Receive a callback when verification is complete.

### 🧾 Manifest-First Verification Design

Each verification uses a flexible JSON manifest to enable unlimited use cases without backend modification:

```json
{
  "contentHash": "sha256:...",
  "creator": "G...",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z",
  "metadata": {
    "device": "Camera Model X",
    "location": "Lat/Long",
    "aiModel": "None"
  }
}
```

## 🔗 On-Chain vs Off-Chain Responsibilities

### ⛓️ On-Chain (Soroban)
*   **Store verification requests**: Acts as the immutable log of requests.
*   **Validate TEE attestation signatures**: Ensures the proof comes from a trusted enclave.
*   **Store trusted TEE code hashes**: Governance mechanism to approve valid TEE versions.
*   **Mint provenance certificates**: Creates the final digital asset.

### 🌐 Off-Chain
*   **File storage**: Handles large media files (expensive on-chain).
*   **Encryption management**: Securely manages keys (KMS).
*   **TEE execution**: Performs heavy computation for verification.
*   **Oracle orchestration**: Coordinates the workflow.

---

## 🛠️ Smart Contracts Overview

1.  **📜 Verification Oracle Contract**: Handles verification request submission, attestation verification, and request state management.
2.  **🏆 Provenance Certificate Contract**: Stores storage IDs, attestation hashes, creator identity, and timestamps.
3.  **🧾 TEE Registry Contract**: Maintains a registry of approved TEE code hashes and trusted Oracle providers.

### 🔐 TEE Attestation Model
Each attestation includes:
*   **TEE signature**: Cryptographic proof of origin.
*   **Code measurement hash**: Proof that the correct code ran.
*   **Input storage hashes**: Proof of what data was processed.
*   **Verification output hash**: The result of the verification.
*   **Execution timestamp**: When it happened.
